Hello, welcome to the bug sim.  
This is just a small fun project for basic simulation of natural selection through randomly varying object stats and attributes in a basic food-providing ecosystem.  
To run, you'll need a graphical program to connect to, which should work natively in linux environments, but will require a program like XLaunch on windows (be sure to connect with `export DISPLAY=:0.0`).  
Upon running main.py, you'll be greeted by a screen with food automatically spawning, but you'll need to spawn the first bugs. The menu on the right of the canvas contains all customization options you may need, including bug spawning templates, food spawn rates, enabling/disabling large plants, and auto-spawning rates for bugs. Here you can also choose to generate statistics on all current bugs.  
This is a fun project, nothing serious; while I'd eventually like to do something more interesting with it (actual growing bug intelligence, not just randomizing stats on a basic path finder to nearest food/enemy), it will likely not be in this same form.  
Ok cool bye
